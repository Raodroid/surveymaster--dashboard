Your gut and brain are very closely connected, both physically and biochemically. They ‘communicate’ through a complex network known as the ‘gut-brain axis’.<br/><br/>Neurotransmitters are the brain’s messengers. They form an important part of the gut-brain axis. They are chemicals produced in your body that influence your feelings and mood – like the brain's postmen, delivering information between different sites of the brain. These are largely produced in the body, but interestingly, the gut microbiome has been shown to produce neurotransmitters too!<br/><br/>In particular, the bacteria in your gut produce GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and serotonin, both of which have significant impact on how we feel emotionally.<br/><br/>Read on to find out more and discover how your gut microbiome may be influencing your brain!",
